Forget searching for that restaurant you're already in to find out if it has terrible ratings, or a desolate menu that you might not enjoy.  This struggle is eliminated with our program GeoByte.

GeoByte pulls your real time location to find out what restaurant/establishment you're currently in, and gives you the ability to go straight to the Yelp page to look at the ratings and/or menu.  This helps the consumer by immediately letting them know whether the new place they've just walked into is a complete dive, or if they should stick around and enjoy what the establishment has to offer.

GeoByte on launch should only ask to use your location once before it is able to retrieve your data and present to you the location you're in.

With the press of the button three of the closest options are shown to you so that if the tracking is not perfectly precise, you are able to choose which place you are in, except the app trying to tell you where you are.
